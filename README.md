# üóÉÔ∏è Java Relational DB Engine ‚Äì From Scratch

This project is a **fully functional relational database server** implemented in Java from the ground up. It parses a custom SQL-like query language, supports persistent file-based storage, and handles advanced operations like JOINs and query parsing ‚Äî all without using external libraries or frameworks for parsing or persistence.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Custom SQL-like query language (as per provided BNF)
- ‚úÖ Fully file-backed persistent data storage in `.tab` format
- ‚úÖ Query commands supported:
  - `CREATE`, `USE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `ALTER`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `JOIN`
- ‚úÖ Relational JOINs with composite column display
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive keywords, whitespace-tolerant parsing
- ‚úÖ Custom **type system** (beyond assignment spec) for:
  - Distinguishing integers, floats, booleans, and strings
  - Type-safe comparisons and operations
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with `[ERROR]` and `[OK]` response tags
- ‚úÖ Maven-based test suite with extensible `JUnit` testing

---

## üß† Why This Matters

While the assignment focused on implementing a minimal database server, this version goes **beyond the brief**:
- Introduced a **type-aware architecture** for robust comparisons and future extensibility.
- Built all parsing and processing logic manually ‚Äî no external parser generators.
- Prioritized code clarity and test coverage as part of a production-like design mindset.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java 17**
- **Maven** for build and test
- **JUnit 5** for automated testing
- No frameworks or database libraries ‚Äì 100% from-scratch design

## üì¶ Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/java/edu/uob/         # Core DB engine code (parser, engine, file IO, types)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/java/edu/uob/         # JUnit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/                 # Sample `.tab` data files and configurations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ databases/                 # File system storage for persistent databases
```

---

## üí° Getting Started

### 1. üîß Compile the Project

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 2. üñ•Ô∏è Run the Server

```bash
./mvnw exec:java@server
```

This starts the DBServer on port `8888`, ready to accept SQL-like queries.

### 3. üß™ Connect the Client

In a separate terminal window:

```bash
./mvnw exec:java@client
```

You can now begin sending SQL-like queries to the server.

---

## üí¨ Example Queries

```sql
CREATE DATABASE peopleDB;
USE peopleDB;
CREATE TABLE users (name, age, isStudent);
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Alice', 22, TRUE);
SELECT * FROM users;
```

```sql
UPDATE users SET age=23 WHERE name=='Alice';
DELETE FROM users WHERE isStudent==FALSE;
DROP TABLE users;
```

### Extended Feature Example ‚Äì Type-Aware Comparison

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20;
```

This query uses type inference to perform proper numeric comparison, made possible by the extended type system.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

Run all test cases:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

The test suite includes:
- Standard query validation (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, etc.)
- Error message handling and malformed input cases
- Type-specific behavior (custom feature)

---

## üìå Notes

- All data is stored under the `databases/` directory in `txt` format.
- Server ensures platform independence using `File.separator`.
- Only one client is expected to connect at a time (single-threaded server).
- Responses follow the `[OK]` / `[ERROR]` convention for automated evaluation.

---

## üß† Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Manual parsing of a formal grammar (BNF-based SQL subset)
- File-based database design
- Command dispatch and interpreter design
- Exception-safe, modular server architecture
- Type-safe computation and operator overloading
- Custom protocol and client-server communication
